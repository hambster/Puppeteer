=========

URL screenshot server powered by PhantomJS and Go.

## Requirements

* [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/)  
* Linux x64

## Installation

For installation, just copy puppeteer binary from **release** directory.

## Usage

Currently, Puppeteer provides 2 executables:

* **puppeteer**: daemon process to take screenshot.  
* **puppeteer-web**: http server to accept http request, and save request as file for puppeteer.

both puppeteer and puppeteer-web take **puppeteer.conf** as command argument.
You can run puppeteer and puppeteer-web like:  

_puppeteer puppeteer.conf&_
_puppeteer-web puppeteer.conf&_

## Project Status

Puppeteer is feature complete currently.  
You can use it to take screenshot now.  
Advanced features will be added in the future.
